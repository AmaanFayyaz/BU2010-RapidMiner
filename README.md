# BU2010-RapidMiner

## Introduction

### Overview

This week we will be working with RapidMiner. 


## Advice

It's best if you **Commit early, commit often** - that way you can go back if you have made a mistake and I can see all the work you have done. It doesn't matter if your early commits contain mistakes.  

Once you are done be sure to commit your changes (that will save them to the repository) and to push them to GitHub (so that I can see the work you have done).

## Task Explanation

For this task, you need to provide the answers in the file you are currently reading. It is a Markdown file. More explanations about the Markdown syntax can be found [on GitHub's Mastering Markdown page](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

**Commit early, commit often** - that way you can go back if you have made a mistake and I can see all the work you have done. It doesn't matter if your early commits contain mistakes.
